The original VISA MP-285 Get Position.vi from time to time failed to retrieve the Sutter position, resulting in an error.
This seems to be the reason why the Sutter did not work in the stack modus of the scanning software from time to time!
The VISA MP-285 Get Position.vi has been improved by Hansjörg & Dominik to avoid that error.
--> Stack modus of the scanning software using the Sutter seems to work fine now.
