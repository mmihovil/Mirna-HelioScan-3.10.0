\chapter{Introduction}

This user guide will help you to install, configure and use \HS, a software package for controlling microscopes. If you want to start extending \HS by developing your own components, please read the Developer Guide. 

In this user guide, we assume that you already have acquired a basic understanding of \HS by reading the publication about \HS in the \textit{Journal of Neuroscience Methods} \cite{Langer2013}. If you miss any information in this manual, please also consult \cite{Langer2011}. In case of further questions, don't hesitate to contact the responsible authors of this manual:
