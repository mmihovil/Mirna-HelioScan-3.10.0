\chapter{Installing HelioScan}

\section{Registering}

You need to register before you will be able to download the \HS software. Please proceed as follows:

\begin{enumerate}
	\item Create a GitHub account\footnote{\url{https://github.com}}. Please choose a human-recognizable user name (i.e., for example rather not \textit{bfg2009}, but preferrably something like \textit{dominik.langer}). This will help us to better keep track of the \HS user base.
	\item Write an email to one of the first two authors of this manual and ask to be added to the HelioScan project at GitHub. Don't forget to mention your user name.
\end{enumerate}

\section{Downloading}

The newest version of \HS can be downloaded as a ZIP file from the \HS website\footnote{\url{http://www.helioscan.org}}. After unzipping, copy the HelioScan directory to an appropriate location on your disk drive. We recommend to copy it directly to the root directory of the drive to have it quickly accessible for all users. 

We also recommend that you keep \HS in a folder that reflects the version number (e.g. c:\textbackslash helioscan-3.2.10). In particular if you have multiple versions of \HS installed, this will allow you easily distinguish between them.
